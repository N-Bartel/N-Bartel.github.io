          <h2><strong>Senior Capstone</strong></h2>
	<h3>Carthage College Physics Major</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            <p>I chose to study physics at Carthage College for a variety of reasons, the most notable being the space sciences research program. The idea of working on a research program was very exciting, as I wanted to be able to apply the knowledge I’d learned in my classes to real world problems and developing new technologies to solve them. Being able to apply what I had learned and studied throughout my coursework to these research programs continued to fuel my motivation to excel. This motivation led me to challenge myself in my courses and eventually led to the opportunity to be an intern at two NASA centers. Choosing to study physics at Carthage College has been one of my best decisions, and I am proud of who I have become.</p>
            <p>I started my involvement with the space science research projects during my first week as a freshman. I joined the Carthage College CubeSat team where I assisted on the Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) subsystem. On this project I gained many skills that would help me in my career ranging from project management to work documentation to technical skills. In addition, I am very proud of the work that I accomplished with Celestine Ananda during our freshman summer for this project. Over the summer we constructed a testing apparatus for the satellite called a Helmholtz cage. A Helmholtz cage is required to calibrate the satellite's magnetometer so that it can accurately determine its position in space. Although the CubeSat has not flown, it was my first venture into the space science world and put me on a trajectory to succeed.</p>
            <p>After working on the small satellite project, I moved to a different research project in which I gained valuable expertise in electronics. In this project, the Modal Propellant Gauging technology development group, I was the electrical lead. I constructed the circuits and systems that were used to power payloads with this technology while in orbit. You can read more about my role <a href="./MicroGraivty.html">here</a>. In addition, my involvement in this project gave me many gifts; experiencing zero gravity, presenting at conferences, meeting Jeff Bezos, watching a rocket launch holding our payload, and winning entrepreneurship competitions - but the greatest gift of all was the experience I gained that prepared me to work with NASA.</p>
            <p>Working at the NASA Langley Research Center and at the NASA Kennedy Space Center provided me the opportunity to witness and experience the functionality of a large organization. At the NASA Langley Research Center I worked with a team of four talented undergraduate and graduate students. The project we worked on was called the Hercules Wind Tunnel Analysis program. I worked on this specific project because of its emphasis on data analysis and the opportunity to learn new skills to grow as a physicist. You can read more about what I worked on <a href="./Langley.html">here</a>. At the NASA Kennedy Space Center I experienced a more traditional internship while working on the Orbital Syngas Commodity Augmentation Reactor, OSCAR, project. I worked on mostly 3D modeling (CAD) work under the guidance of my mentor, Evan Bell. You can read more about what I worked on by <a href="./Kennedy.html">clicking this link</a>.</p>
            <p>Although I have only spoken about my projects and research, these were really in the background of my Carthage experience - my coursework and professors were in the foreground and prepared me for my future as much as my other experiences did. Even though my time as studying to become a physicist is coming to a close, I am confident that the thought process and analysis will be invaluable in whatever field I end up working in. My most favorite classes were Fundamental Physics and Modern Physics because they showed me how strange the world really is, and how much I still have to learn. The inspiration I obtained from these classes reminded me why I went to school for physics.</p>
            <p>Although my chapter at Carthage is coming to a close, I’m opening the beginning of a new adventure. I will be travelling to Colorado this May to start a new chapter in my life that I know will be just as exciting as the last. My time at Carthage shaped me into who I am today, and I could not be happier and prouder in my reflection of my time spent, and how it prepared me to become who I am.</p>
               <p>I now would like to acknowledge and thank a few members of the Carthage community. Although everyone I have encountered has taught me valuable lessons, I am most grateful to the following individuals and organizations. I would like to thank Dr. Kevin Crosby for mentoring me through all of my research projects and for the opportunities that he has provided to help me grow and learn. In addition, I would like to thank the Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium for funding my scientific endeavors and research. In academia I would like to thank Dr. Jean Quashnock and Dr. Brant Carlson for believing in me and pushing me to develop a better understanding of the world around me, and to continue asking questions about how things work. In my social life I would like to thank Chance, Megham, Tom, Adam, Max, and Ben for: keeping me entertained, helping keep me stay motivated, and for all the fun memories we made throughout college. Finally, I am most grateful to Celestine Ananda for: offering me guidance, going on adventures with me, and for creating a future together.</p>
